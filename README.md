# Ethereum Price Analysis with Time Series Applications

## Overview

This repository contains the project "Ethereum Price Analysis with Time Series Applications", which was developed as part of the **STAT497 Time Series Applications course at Middle East Technical University**. The goal of this study is to forecast **Ether (ETH) prices** using historical data from 2016 to 2024 by applying various time series models.

## Methodology
**Data Preprocessing**

Handling missing values and anomalies.
Applying Box-Cox transformation to stabilize variance.

**Stationarity Testing**

Conducted KPSS, ADF, and HEGY tests to check for stationarity.
Differenced the series to remove trends and make it stationary.

**Model Selection & Forecasting**

![Arima](ARIMA_forecast.jpg)

Evaluated multiple models including:
ARIMA(0,1,3)
TBATS
Prophet
Neural Networks
Exponential Smoothing (Simple, Holt’s, Holt-Winter’s)
Used AIC, BIC, MAPE, MAE, RMSE metrics for model comparison.

**Results & Findings**

Neural Network model outperformed other models in forecasting ETH prices.
Holt’s Exponential Smoothing was the best among exponential smoothing models.
ARIMA(0,1,3) was the best ARIMA/SARIMA model for this dataset.
